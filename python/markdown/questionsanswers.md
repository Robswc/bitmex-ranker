## Q: Why do the notional USD charts not align with the "USD Profit"?
The "USD Profit" is an approximation, since the ranker didn't start collecting data till Sept. 2019.  The total USD is calculated by taking the total BTC profit * the average BTC price over the lifetime of the Bitmex XBTUSD trading pair. Unless there is access to historical leaderboards, this approximation can be over or under estimating by several million.
## Q: What happens if someone changes their name?
Since there is no unique ID accessible from the leaderboard API, there is no way to keep the data consistent other than manually merging the two names into one.  If you suspect a name change, please create an issue on github so it can be fixed!
## Q: What happens if a trader falls below 25?
As long as the trader has appeared on the leaderboard at least once, their data will be collected and accessible.
